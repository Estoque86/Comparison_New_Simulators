Thanks for your interest in ccnSim. This brief document will guide you through the installation process of ccnSim.


ccnSim Requirements
-------------------

ccnSim requires Omnet++ and the Boost libraries (since v0.2). This guide assumes
you have Omnet++ and the Boost libraries installed.

* If you do not have Omnet++ (version >= 4.1) installed, download it from
http://www.omnetpp.org and install it following the Omnet++ installation
instructions

* To install boost, either use the standard package manager of your Linux
distribution (e.g., apt-get or yum) or download it from http://www.boost.org/
and follow instructions therein 


ccnSim Installation
-------------------

In order to install ccnSim, it is first necessary to patch Omnet++, after
which you can compile the ccnSim sources.

Assuming that $CCNSIM_DIR and $OMNET_DIR are the installation directories of
ccnSim and Omnet++, issue these commands on a terminal to compile ccnSim:

     cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     cp ./patch/ctopology.h $OMNET_DIR/include/
     cp ./patch/ctopology.cc $OMNET_DIR/src/sim
     cd $OMNET_DIR && make && cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     ./scripts/makemake.sh
     make


Then, fine-tune your environment by instructing Omnetpp to load ccnSim .ned 
files (by configuring the NEDPATH environment variable;  you may want to add
also the local dir "." to let Omnetpp load .ned files from the current folder),
and finally put the ccnSim executable (soft-linked in $CCNSIM_DIR) in your path
(e.g.,  by adding $CCNSIM_DIR to your PATH environment variable): 

     export NEDPATH=$CCNSIM_DIR:.
     export PATH=$PATH:$CCNSIM_DIR
     
You should then be able to run ccnSim simulations -- report to the ccnSim
website for some examples, scripts and inspiration.
