What's new in v0.3




* Cost-aware caching  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ccnSim-0.3 implements the cost-aware cache decision policies introduced in:

	A. Araldo, D. Rossi, F. Martignon, ``Design and Evaluation of 
	Cost-aware Information Centric Routers,'' in ACM SIGCOMM Information
	Centric	Networking (ICN'14), Paris, September 2014
	
Some simple scripts are provided at the ccnSim website to boostrap you with
cost-aware simulation




* Random number generation  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous versions all modules used a unique random number generator
(RNG). This means that, for example, calls to the RNG made by a cache decision
policy algorithm can influence the sequence of random requests. 

It follows that comparing two simulations using the same RNG seed, but differnt
caching policies (e.g, Leave a Copy Everywhere, that does not employ the RNG,
and Fixed Probabilistic Decisions, that instead employs it) would be performed
on different, although stochastically equivalent, input sequences.

In order to decouple the request generation from cache operation and any other
actions requiring a call to the RNG, starting from v0.3 the RNG for workload
generation and cache decisions are separated.  See parameter RNG in omnetpp.ini.




*  Improved robustness
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to (the usual) bug fixes, changes were also made in order for the
code to be more robust, such as:

*  Additional checks of the user input (omnetpp.ini and network ned files)
   written

* SEVERE_DEBUG mode introduced to help debug (See Ch 2 of the ccnSim manual).
